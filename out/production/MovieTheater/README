Assumptions:
1. Safety is the number one priority for customers, thus the buffer requirements is the most important.
2. Customers who request a reservation prefer to be seated as close to each other as possible.
3. Some customers would be fine to see the movie at a current time if the group needed to be split up
4. Customers prefer to be seated towards the back of the screen so they do not have to strain their neck
   as much looking up at the screen.

How to use the code given an input file:
    1. In the source folder compile the program by typing "javac *.java" into cmd and hitting enter.
    2. Get the path of the input file call it filePath
    3. Run the program by typing "java Runner filePath" at the command prompt.
    4. The program will give the path to an output file, which will contain the output.
    ** If the user wants to change the output file, change the pathName variable in Runnner.java. **

To execute test InputTests/inputX.txt (substitute all occurences of inputX.txt with pathname for test input file);
    in command , input the command below:

type InputTests\input9.txt && echo.  && java Runner InputTests\input9.txt && type C:\Users\Vishnu\IdeaProjects\MovieTheater\src\theaterSeatingAssignments.txt.
    ** if the output path is changed from default, substitute C:\Users\Vishnu\IdeaProjects\MovieTheater\src\theaterSeatingAssignments.txt. with the output file**

First Prints the input file. Then the Output file path. Then the contents of the output file after execution.
